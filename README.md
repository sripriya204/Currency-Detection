# Currency Detection with YOLOv5

This project demonstrates how to use YOLOv5 for detecting currency notes. The setup involves training the YOLOv5 model on a custom dataset and running inference on new images to detect and classify currency notes.

## Description

Currency Detection with YOLOv5 is a project designed to detect and identify different currency notes using the YOLOv5 object detection framework. It involves training a model on a dataset of labeled currency images and then using this model to detect currency notes in new images.

## Features

- Train a YOLOv5 model on a custom dataset of currency images.
- Detect and classify currency notes in new images.
- Save detection results, including bounding boxes and confidence scores.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository and install dependencies.
2. Prepare your dataset following the YOLOv5 format.
3. Train the YOLOv5 model on your dataset.
4. Run inference using the trained model to detect currency notes in new images.
